give me ONLY A  small paragraph of maximum 4 lines of explanation nothing more nothing less as to why this team was selected. Theese are the features we checked make sure this is also taken into consideration:
-we have maximum 4 overseas players.
-we have to make sure the bowling is stable, such as usage of new ball - death overs - middle overs should be included and also suppose if there is lot of allphase make sure to add that since he is a bowler who bowls throughout the game he is added.
-also mention why certain players were picked since the team plays in the {stadium}.
-we have to make sure the batting is stable, with finisher, few hard hitters, an explosive opener, and suppose if there is an anchor batter and if he does get replaced mention that he was replaced because consistent batter exists.

I WANT AN EXPLANATION OF WHY THEY'RE SELECTED USING DETAILS ABOVE. MAKE SURE ITS ONLY MAIXMUM OF 4 LINES
